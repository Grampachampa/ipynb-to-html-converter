Note: The names and locations of the .ipynb files don't matter (as long as it's in the parent directory or a subdirectory of it). 

### 2) Run "RUN THIS ONE.ipynb" 🚀
Open the file "RUN THIS ONE.ipynb", give the cells a read, and run them in sequence. Modify the essential parameters indicated by the instructions inside.

## Final Notes/Quirks 📝
Outlook can be weird with automated emails - where they don't show up as "Sent", despite you sending them. As a result, the script Cc's the sender (you) in every email. To avoid a flooded inbox, set up a folder in Outlook for emails sent by yourself that contain "Feedback and Results" in the title. This way, you don't end up with 450+ emails in your inbox. Addressing this is on my bucket list, but I can't guarantee that solutions will be found.
